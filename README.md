Fido V5 by Tom Jennings

This is source code by and from Tom Jennings (see "FidoNet"). This repository is placed here mainly for historical reasons and archiving. This source code does compile, but you need to work on it a little bit, unless you can find yourself a DOS C compiler "from way back" :) Many things eventually came to exist because of this code and the person behind it. Pretty cool when you think about it.
